### Project: Face Mask Detector 

In this project, we will be developing a face mask detector that can distinguish between faces with masks and faces with no masks. In this report, we have proposed a detector that employs SSD for face detection and a neural network to detect the presence of a face mask. The implementation of the algorithm is on images, videos, and live video streams.
